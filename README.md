### Objectives

Understand how javascript influenced the web.  

### Javascript: it's kinda a big deal

So in the previous lesson we learned the answer to what is javascript.  Javascript adds behavior to our html.  Or in dev speak:
  * Javascript is a scripting language created to bring interactivity to the browser

Javascript is not
  * Java

  > Note: Java is a very different language and is not technically related to or even all that similar to javascript.  


Various tools and libraries are built in javascript like:
  * D3 a charts animation library
  * React, Ember and Angular
  * Node Js
  * React Native - provides ability to use

Because javascript is the language of the browser, it is no surprise of it's popularity.  A widespread developer survey showed that over 85% of full-stack developers use javascript.  

### But it spent its early years unloved and shunned
In 1995, Netscape browser dominated the web, and owned over three quarters of the browser market.  Marc Andreessen the company's founder asked Brendan Eich to embed a programming language in the Netscape browser.  Brendan wrote the language in just ten days.  Javascript was born.

So Javascript was written in 10 days in 1995.  There were no updates to the language until 2009.  Let's think about that.

  Yea in 1994, there were nearly twice as many pagers in use 60 million as cell phones 34 million.

  The iPhone had been around since June 2007.  In 2009, it was the world's third most popular cell phone.

So while the remote communications have gone from not yet popularizing voice technology to having internet access, javascript remained unchanged.  Why?

### 1995 - 2005: Not my programming language to the way of the web

For the first ten years of it's existence, professional developers did not really consider javascript a programming language.  Designers might use it to add some slick animation, but the really important parts of the site like retrieving specific data, performing calculations, was done elsewhere.  

Then in 2005, something happened.  Google maps came out.  Before google maps there was mapquest.  And every time a user wanted to view another part of a map, he would have to wait for a full page refresh and the page to fully reload.  With google maps, a user could drag around the map and it would smoothly update.  There would be no full refresh.  

The technology behind this was called an XHR, which stands for XMLHTTPrequest (XML-HTTP-request).  It allows users to act on a page (such as dragging a map), or for an update to occur without a page refresh.  This allowed programmers to start to look at Javascript as a medium for creating interactive web applications.

### 2005-Present: Javascript Emergence

Soon after the debut of Google Maps, programmers began building their own mechanisms to enhance javascript.  In 2006, John Resig, then a 21 year old student at Rochester Institute of Technology, developed the Jquery library.  Jquery is a library, built in Javascript, that allows programmers to write javascript code that interacts with different browsers.  In 2009, Ryan Dahl released Node js, which allowed developers to code their entire web application using just one programming language: javascript.  

By 2010, developers began writing so much of their application with Javascript code that Javascript frameworks were released.  Frameworks allow developers to code more easily by encouraging specific practices, and including useful libraries.  In 2010, Google released the AngularJS framework, and today it is used by 10,000 companies including PayPal and the Youtube.  In 2013, Facebook released React, which today is used by companies like Netflix, Yahoo!, and Khan Academy.  Additional frameworks React Native allow developers to build professional grade Android and IPhone apps with Javascript.  

### Upgrades to Javascript

In 2015, the powers that make Javascript updated the language, to make it more developer friendly.  With all of these updates to Javascript, and with the flexibility that the language provides, the Javascript community is still rapidly developing best practices as to how to write Javascript code.  Dan Abramov made a major contribution to how programmers use Javascript with Redux in 2015.

### The Point

This is the world where you begin your Javascript journey.  Not with language and tools that are mature and polished, but emergent and still developing.  With patterns and frameworks that mean that even the most experienced developers can only been exposed to them for a two years.  And where developers question how their long held tenets apply to this new world.  And to think all of this about shuffling around some Html, and rearranging the DOM.  But how do we even use Javascript to interact with our HTML?  Great question.  Let's use that to begin our coding journey.
